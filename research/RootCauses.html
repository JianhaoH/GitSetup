                <li class="text-start">"Most participants reported avoiding treatment early on to circumvent a label of mental illness. Participants initially reported experiencing some degree of self-stigma; however, following engagement in treatment they predominantly resisted these stereotypes.</li>

                Explanation #1
              <ul>
                  <li class="text-start">Very few SA survivors seek medical attention for their trauma, which leads to them living with them their entire life and never confronting it.</li>

            <div class="col border table-borderless">
                Explanation #2
              <ul>
                  <li class="text-start">Due to public stigmatization and stereotypes of PTSD, some avoid treatment in the early stages of PTSD to avoid labels of mental illness.</li>

            <div class="col border table-borderless">
                Explanation #1

                  <li class="text-start">PTSD in children and foster/orphaned children in particular are often neglected as they don't have the access to the resources necessary.</li>

            </div>
            <div class="col border table-borderless">
                Explanation #2
              <ul>
                  <li class="text-start">PTSD is often underdiagonsed and can sometimes be misdiagonsed with other mental illnesses as PTSD shares many of the symptoms of depression.</li>

              Implications #1
              <ul>
                  <li class="text-start">Those who experience a sudden traumatic event are often unwilling to seek medical help. Destigmatization of mental disorders may help victims of PTSD feel more comfortable seeking help.</li>

            <div class="col border border-4">

              <ul>
                  <li class="text-start">Access to medical attention for PTSD is also critical towards recovery, children in foster homes or orphanages often are never treated for their PTSD. Diagonsis accuracy should also be increased and treatment options made more avalible.</li>
